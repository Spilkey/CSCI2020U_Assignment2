# How to run
Download .idea, src, ClientFiles, ServerFiles folders and run:
Server.main()
then
Client.main()
In intellij (The command line arguments <ClientFiles> <ServerFiles> should be in the client config already).

Theres already some .txt files in the ClientFiles and ServerFiles folder if you wish to test with those.
